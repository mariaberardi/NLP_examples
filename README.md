Some examples of NLP tools and techniques I used in a project in the past. 

From August to December 2021 I was part of a team of students from Purdue University collaborating with Merck on the design and development of an application for collection and analysis of patient biometric data during clinical trials. My main role on the team was to develop tools to perform sentiment analysis on the textual responses submitted by patients through the application. This repository only contains some examples of the NLP tools we used, and not the final product.
